    <p1>On 30 July 2013, the Congress Working Committee unanimously passed a resolution to recommend the formation of a
        separate Telangana state. After various stages the bill was placed in the Parliament of India in February
        2014.[48] In February 2014, Andhra Pradesh Reorganisation Act, 2014 bill was passed by the Parliament of India
        for the formation of Telangana state, comprising ten districts from north-western Andhra Pradesh.[49] The bill
        received the assent of the president and was published in the Gazette on 1 March 2014.[50]

        The state of Telangana was officially formed on 2 June 2014. Kalvakuntla Chandrashekar Rao was elected as the
        first chief minister of Telangana, following elections in which the Telangana Rashtra Samithi party secured
        majority.[51] Hyderabad will remain as the joint capital of both Telangana and Andhra Pradesh for a period, not
        more than ten years after that period Hyderabad shall be the capital of the state of Telangana and there shall
        be a new capital for the state of Andhra Pradesh.[52] Andhra Pradesh picked Amaravati as its capital and
        relocated its secretariat in 2016 and its legislature in 2017.[53][54]

    <p2>The emblem was designed by painter, Laxman Aelay.[4] It was adopted on 2 June 2014 after the newly formed
        government headed by K. Chandrashekar Rao adopted it. It was the first file to be signed by him after swearing
        in. Initially, Charminar was not included, but after the advice of Asaduddin Owaisi, (Hyderabad MP), it was
        added.

        Initially the national motto was written below the emblem. Naresh Kadyan, Abhishek Kadyan, and Sukanya Kadyan
        complained to the government about the alleged insult of the Emblem without the motto. The Sarnath Lion Capital,
        when used in heraldry, is required to have the words Satyameva Jayate underneath it, as per the State Emblem of
        India (Prohibition of Improver Use) Act, 2005, which the new logo violated when it was first released.[5] The
        emblem was corrected with an amendment approved by the Government of Telangana on 25 June 2014 made by Laxman
        Aelay, by moving the Satyameva Jayate below the Sarnath Lion Capital, complying with the national norm.

    <h5>food</h5>
<p3>For some people, food is just a necessity to satisfy basic needs; for the others, food is more than just a basic necessity, but a pleasure that plays a significant role in their understanding of happiness. There are so many different cuisines and food preferences built by cultural and ethnical backgrounds, geographical locations and social classes. Food and popular meals can tell us a lot about the history and traditions of various nations and regions. Meat eating habits, herbs, and crops â€“ everything makes its contribution to the traditional cuisine and culture. India is a land of spices, Africa is a continent of sauces, Europe discloses esthetical beauty of food and opens up new opportunities and inventions for those who value and enjoy eating.

    Eating habits change over time and follow climate, cultural and other transformations that determined the evolution of the communities. Changes in the way people serve the table, evolution of European and Asian business etiquette, food preferences according to the surveys in different countries and other elements that allow measuring and analyzing the evolution of food help us understand the history.</p3>
